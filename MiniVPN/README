How to run the VPN
=================

- Make sure that both the Gatway VMs have the same folder called 'MiniVPN' 
and make sure you cd into this direcotry
- Ensure that the correct port forwarding rules have been set up for the VMs
on the physical machines.
	- SSL sockey port number is: 20407
	- UDP tunnel port number is: 20405

On GatewayB (server)
--------------------
- On line# 701 (strncpy(remote_ip,MC02_IP,15);), change MC02_IP to MC03_IP
- Run make to compile the code
- Execute the command sudo ./minivpn -h to print usage options of the program
- Execute the command sudo ./minivpn -s to run as server and enter 'server'
as the pass phrase when prompted
	- You can add more flags depending on if you want to print out verbose
	print outs or if you want to run a specific test.

<Now move on to the GatewayA (client)>

- Open another terminal tab and execute the command bash bash simpletun_config_GatewayB.sh 
	- This will set up the virtual network interface

<Now go back to GatewayA (client)>

On GatewayA (client)
--------------------
- Make sure that line 701 has MC02_IP, not MC03_IP
- Run make to compile the code
- Execute the command sudo ./minivpn -c <mc02 ip address> to run the program
as the client
- Open another terminal tab and execute the command bash bash simpletun_config_GatewayA.sh 
	- This will set up the virtual network interface

<Now go back to GatewayB> 

- Now execute the command bash connect_vhost_a1.sh
	- This will ssh into the VirtualHostA1
- Once inside, you can now ping or ssh into VirtualHostB1
	- The IP of VirtualHostB1 as of now is 10.0.20.124
